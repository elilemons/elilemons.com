# Intro

I made this website many moons ago as a way to show off some stuff I was working on. At the moment it is used as a place to keep my resume.

## Deployment
This will automatically deploy when pushed to github. See the cpanel yml file for more information.

You will have to log into CPanel to manually trigger a "Deploy HEAD Commit" from the Git Version Control.
